# StatPool
A simple, efficient stat management system for Godot games. Perfect for health bars, mana pools, stamina systems, hunger meters, or any numeric stat that needs min/max bounds and signal notifications.

## Why Use StatPool?
Managing stats in games is annoying. You always end up writing the same code over and over:
- Clamping values between min/max
- Emitting signals when things change
- Checking if you're at boundaries (empty/full)
- Calculating percentages for UI bars

### Target platforms:
| Platform | Supported Systems |
|----------|------------------|
| **Desktop** | ü™ü Windows ‚Ä¢ üêß Linux ‚Ä¢ üçé MacOS |
| **Mobile** | ü§ñ Android ‚Ä¢ üì± iOS |
| **Others** | üåê Web |

## Why C++ Instead of GDScript?
Simple - performance. If you have 100+ enemies each with health/mana/stamina stats, that's 300+ StatPools that need to be managed. C++ handles this way better than GDScript.

(Also because I did this plugin to challange myself, since it's been a good 8 years since the last time I coded anything C++ related.)

## Requirements
- [Godot 4.3+](https://godotengine.org/) (might work on earlier versions, I haven't tested)
or
- [Redot 4.3+](https://www.redotengine.org/)
