# StatPool
A simple, efficient stat management system for Godot games. Perfect to be used for health, mana pools, stamina systems, hunger meters, or any numeric stat that needs min/max bounds and signal notifications.

## Why Use StatPool?
Managing stats in games is annoying. You always end up writing the same code over and over:
- Clamping values between min/max
- Emitting signals when things change
- Checking if you're at boundaries (empty/full)
- Calculating percentages for UI bars

This is a GDExtension plugin, this means it was done with performance in mind.
